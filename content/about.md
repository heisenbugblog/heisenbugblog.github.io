"A bug that disappears or alters its behavior when one attempts to probe or isolate it." - [The Jargon File](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/heisenbug.html)

Here at The Heisenbug Blog, we share our experience on effective programming and code quality in the C and C++ language as well as project automation with Gradle.

How do we do this? By comparing different implementation scenario according to speed, size and complexity within the realm of C and C++. We also provide insight on the internal of Gradle. Finally, we present advance continous integration pipeline design targeting specifically the native world.
